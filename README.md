# BSC-CS-Sem4-LinearAlgerbraPracticals
These have all the practicals performed by me in semester 4 for the module Linear Algebra
All these practicals are performed in python but no inbuilt libraries have been used, hence these codes can be converted to java or C or to any other programming language.
